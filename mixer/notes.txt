libopus
	not easy to compile (under windows)
	thers a binary distribution of libopusfile which contains a libopus.dll (yay)
	got it to link
	setting up websockets was easy with qt
	got a tiny dummy client to connect with mixer
	works, getting data
	decode of libopus failes, let try different parameters (frequency etc)
	trying firefox instead of chrome, maybe that'll help...  nope
	looking at several examples for using the data that the js MediaRecorder provides
	trying several mime types for both chrome and firefox ... this doesn't help
	changed mixer to just save every binary websocket message as a .opus file, now trying to play it back using several audio players (vlc, foobar)
	audio players also not working, is what we are receiving actually valid audio data?!
	now trying to convert the .opus file using ffmpeg... holy smokes this works, the output .wav filed can be played back and contain audio from the mic
	realization: the data that is sent are not raw opus frames, but actually opus within a webm container or ogg container for firefox
	we'll need ffmpeg libs to handle that

ffmpeg
	oh boy, the ffmpeg libs have a huge api... and the documentation is, ehm, not so great
	ok, we need to get a handle to the format, then use that format to build some sort of converter stream i guess. This is gonna take some time...
	ffmpeg is built to handle files, but we have our data in memory. So we need to build a custom AVIOContext that reads data from memory. Great...
	custom AVIOContext works! We even have autodetection of the input format, neat! No lets try to convert to wav/pcm
